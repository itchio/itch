The goal of this project is to give you a desktop application that you can
download and run games from [itch.io](http://itch.io) with. Additionally you
should be able to update games and get notified when games are updated. The
goal is not to replace the itch.io website.

## About itch-setup

[itch-setup](https://github.com/itchio/itch-setup) is the installer program for the itch app.

It's a Go executable that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux, and downloads the latest
version of the app directly from <https://itch.io>.

Although itch-setup is normally served from <https://itch.io/app>, the canonical
source to download it (e.g. for packaging purposes), is the following download server:

  * <https://broth.itch.ovh/>

broth is maintained by itch.io employees, and serves various packages related to the
itch app.
