# Appendix(es)

The great thing about game development is that people of all horizons are
involved in it. They all have different backgrounds, different experience, and
are not always fully informed on all the many knowledge domains creating and
publishing a game requires.

While this book is focused on the itch app, we felt like some subjects slightly
beyond the scope of the app deserved their own section.
