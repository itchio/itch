# User preferences

User preferences can be accessed from the user menu, or by using the keyboard
shortcut `Ctrl+,` (`Command+,` on macOS).

Preferences apply to a particular install of itch on a machine, for all
itch.io sessions using it: sessions share languages, install locations, and
so on. They're distinct from [itch.io user settings](https://itch.io/user/settings).
