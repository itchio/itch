## For game developers

Refer to the [app faq](https://itch.io/docs/app/faq) to know how to get your game running!

## Installing

itch is built in HTML/SCSS/ES2015 and runs inside of Electron. Install the
following to get started with development:

* Install [node.js][] (version *5.4.x* is recommended)
* Install [electron][]:

[node.js]: https://nodejs.org/
[electron]: https://github.com/atom/electron

```
npm install -g electron-prebuilt@0.36.4

* Check out this repository

* Install the javascript dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

* Install grunt's CLI if you don't have it already:

```bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```

* You can now run the app:

```bash
$ npm start
```

This command first compiles newer files from ES2016 to a subset of ES6
understood by both Node.js & Chromium, in strict mode.

We use [grunt][] for building and packaging, see our [CI job definitions][ci].

[babel]: http://babeljs.io/
[grunt]: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt
[ci]: https://github.com/itchio/ci.itch.ovh/blob/master/src/jobs/itch.yml

### Running tests

Run:

```bash
$ npm test
```

To run all tests. You can run a single test with:

```bash
$ test/runner test/util/os-spec.js
```

Or run all the tests in a directory with:

```bash
$ test/runner test/components
```

[tap-spec]: https://github.com/scottcorgan/tap-spec

`test/runner` is a bash script, so if you're on Win32 running on PowerShell or cmd.exe,
you might want to use this variant:

```PowerShell
$ grunt; node test/runner.js test/components
```

Note that this will run tests even if `grunt` invocation fails. If someone
knows a good replacement for `&&` in PowerShell, please open an issue.

### Debug facilities

**:memo: When running from msys, `export OS=cygwin` to see log output**

These keys do things:

  * `Shift-F5` — reload the UI. Since the state is stored outside of the browser,
    this shouldn't corrupt
  * `Shift-F12` — open Chromium developer tools, to inspect the DOM, run arbitrary javascript code, etc.

These environment variables will change the behavior of the app:

  * `DEVTOOLS=1` — start with Chromium Devtools open — useful when something goes
    wrong before the `F12` binding becomes available.
  * `MARCO_POLO=1` — dumps all Flux events being dispatched throughout the app.
    We attempt to filter that (see `private` field in payloads) but **please
    pay extra care to any logs you post publicly** to make sure you're not leaking
    your own credentials.
  * `LET_ME_IN=1` — dump itch.io API calls to console
  * `DIEGO_IS_ASLEEP=1` - forbid [our diagnostics tool][diego] from running commands like
    `uname`, `lspci`, `sw_vers`, `wmic`, and `ver` on your system and writing
    the results to a file on your local disk.
  * `CAST_NO_SHADOW=1` — opens devtools for the purchase window
  * `NO_TEACHING=1` — disable featured collections (useful to debug data transfer
    between node and browser side)
  * `TRUST_ME_IM_AN_ENGINEER=1` - never show `Buy now` instead of `Install`.
    Obviously, the backend has to agree with you.
  * `REMEMBER_ME_WHEN_IM_GONE=1` - don't wipe downloads when uninstalling.
    Useful for debugging install/uninstall routines.
  * `THE_DEPTHS_OF_THE_SOUL=1` - print debug info when extracting certain archives
  * `IMMEDIATE_NOSE_DIVE=1` - open dev tools before launching html games
