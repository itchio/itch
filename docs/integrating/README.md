# Game developer guide

This chapter describes how to distribute software that can be installed
and ran with the itch app.

Often, you'll find it disappointingly simple (most things should work out
of the box). Nevertheless, this chapter is useful for special cases, or
for creators willing to go the extra mile when integrating with it.

*Note: even though the word 'game' is used throughout this guide, it applies
equally to other kinds of software. Games just happen to be the most popular
kind of software installed with the app!*
